    # # The above code defines a function called `CustomChatGPT` that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to

    # # returns a response generated by the model. The conversation history is stored in the `messages`
    # # list, which is updated with each user input and model response. The `gradio` library is used to
    # create a user interface for interacting with the chatbot.

    # text that the user enters to communicate with the chatbot
    # # :return: The code is creating a chatbot interface using the Gradio library. The `CustomChatGPT`
    # # function takes user input, appends it to the `messages` list, and sends it to the OpenAI Chat API to
    # # get a response. The response is then appended to the `messages` list and returned as the output of
    # the function.
